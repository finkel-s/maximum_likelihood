We will begin with logit and probit models for binary outcomes (e.g. individuals voting or abstaining in an election) and link those models to the broader \"generalized linear model\" framework. We'll then cover maximum likelihood methods for estimating parameters in logit and probit (and many other) models, and discuss recent issues and problems in the specification, estimation and interpretation of these models. We'll then move on to models for other common non-continuous dependent variables: *ordinal outcomes* (e.g., regimes being \"repressive,\" \"semi-repressive,\" or \"free\"); *nominal outcomes* with more than two unordered categories (e.g. voting for a \"Left\", \"Right\", \"Populist\" or \"Green\" party); *count outcomes*, e.g. the number of vetoes exercised by Presidents during a given term in office; and *censored outcomes*, where the values of observations above or below a certain point are unknown (e.g. \"desired\" campaign contributions where the observed amount is legally capped at a certain value). We will then consider models for categorical and limited variables in multilevel or longitudinal data structures (e.g., multiple observations over time for the same individuals, or multiple individuals observed in different countries). The final unit will cover methods that attempt to handle the problems of *endogenous regressor* and *sample-selection biases* in order to estimate causal effects in models for non-continuous outcomes.\n\nThe goals of the class are for you to be able to use these methods in your own research, and to understand and critique published works in the discipline that make use of these techniques.\n:::\n\n## Texts\n\n::: justify-text\n-   Long, J.
