## Course Description

This course focuses on models for the analysis of categorical and other kinds of non-continuous dependent variables, which are typically estimated via maximum likelihood estimation methods. We will begin with logit and probit models for binary outcomes (e.g. individuals voting or abstaining in an election) and link those models to the broader “generalized linear model” framework. We’ll then cover maximum likelihood methods for estimating parameters in logit and probit (and many other) models, and discuss recent issues and problems in the specification, estimation and interpretation of these models. We’ll then move on to models for other common non-continuous dependent variables: *ordinal outcomes* (e.g., regimes being “repressive,” “semi-repressive,” or “free”); *nominal outcomes* with more than two unordered categories (e.g. voting for a “Left”, “Right”, “Populist” or “Green” party); *count outcomes*, e.g. the number of vetoes exercised by Presidents during a given term in office; and *censored outcomes*, where the values of observations above or below a certain point are unknown (e.g. “desired” campaign contributions where the observed amount is legally capped at a certain value). We will then consider models for categorical and limited variables in multilevel or longitudinal data structures (e.g., multiple observations over time for the same individuals, or multiple individuals observed in different countries). The final unit will cover methods that attempt to handle the problems of *endogenous regressor* and *sample-selection biases* in order to estimate causal effects in models for non-continuous outcomes. 

The goals of the class are for you to be able to use these methods in your own research, and to understand and critique published works in the discipline that make use of these techniques.

## Course Requirements

Grades will be based on a 20-25 page research paper (40%), two homework exercises which relate to specific statistical methods and problems we will discuss (25% each), and an oral presentation of your research paper (10%). The paper will be a quantitative analysis using methods from this course of data that you will collect or access from social science archives or other sources.

The paper should have some substantive interest to you or be relevant to your studies in the graduate program; ideally, you can think of it as the first draft of a convention paper or possible journal publication. The paper will discuss your basic theoretical framework, your hypotheses, statistical models, results, possible problems with the analysis and what you may have done to correct or account for these problems. It will conclude with a discussion of the relevance of your findings for the general topic and for future research.

## Course Outline

The course is organized by units and then topics within units. We will maintain a certain amount of flexibility with the schedule, so that we can spend more time on some topics/units and scale back on others as circumstances warrant.
